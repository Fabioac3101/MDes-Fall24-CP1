      <strong>Hold It!</strong>

      Do you want to get rid of the fog in everyday life. It's easy just take your index finger and hold it over the green circle and everything will clear up.

      For this project I took the Hand Pose reference sketch from ml5 as a foundation. I adjusted the code so that it would only keep the index finger referenced and added the circle almost as a "switch."
      The idea is to make it interactive and this is the first exploration. The next step is to take an object not hand to achieve the same goal and create a story with it.
